C++ is pretty similar to Java, every line ends with ;

To run a C++ file,
g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName
./fileName

// single-line comment

/*
multi-line comment
*/

#include <iostream> will usually be in every C++ file. It basically brings in the standard input/output library

cout << "" ;
cin >> num ;
