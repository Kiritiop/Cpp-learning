C++ is pretty similar to Java, every line ends with ;

To run a C++ file,
g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName
./fileName

// single-line comment

/*
multi-line comment
*/

#include <iostream> will usually be in every C++ file. It basically brings in the standard input/output library

Namespace
A namespace is basically a way to group functions together, similar to importing a file in python and using its functions (same same but different)
Used to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.
using namespace std;

cout << " " ; output
cout << " " << num << " " << endl;
cin >> num ; input, only reads untill the first white space

Data types
int num = 2;                        // Integer 
float num = 3.14f;                 // Decimals, uses 4 bytes, 7 digits, needs f at the end or else it is treated as a double automatically
double doub = 3.1415926;          // Decimals, uses 8 bytes, 15-16 digits
char letter = 'a';               // Character
bool yes = true;                // Boolean
You can also use auto to let the computer automatically assign a data type to your variable
Note: You must assign the value of the variable at the same time if using auto.
auto num = 5 -> num will be automatically an integer


String is not part of base C++, it needs std::string. String should be imported when you #include <iostream>, if not then #include <String>
std::string text = "Hello World!";  // String

const float pi = 3.14f; constant, not to be changed

Operations
Same as other languages, +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical operators: && = and, || = or, ! = not
Pre-increment/decrement, post-increment/decrement: ++a, --a, a++, a-- difference in executing action first or adding first

Operators are evaluated in a specific order:

Parentheses ()
Unary operators (++, --, !, etc.)
Multiplication, division, modulus (*, /, %)
Addition, subtraction (+, -)
Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=)
Equality operators (==, !=)
Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)

If statements:
if () {

} else if () {

} else {

}
