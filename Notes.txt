C++ is pretty similar to Java, every line ends with ;

To run a C++ file,
g++ fileName.cpp -o fileName
./fileName

// single-line comment

/*
multi-line comment
*/

#include <iostream> will usually be in every C++ file. It basically brings in the standard input/output library

Namespace
A namespace is basically a way to group functions together, similar to importing a file in python and using its functions (same same but different)
Used to organize code and avoid naming conflicts.
using namespace std;

cout << " " ; output
cout << " " << num << " " << endl;
cin >> num ; input, only reads untill the first white space
getline(cin, variable); Reads the line of text and stores it in the variable

Data types
int num = 2;                        // Integer 
float num = 3.14f;                 // Decimals, uses 4 bytes, 7 digits, needs f at the end or else it is treated as a double automatically
double doub = 3.1415926;          // Decimals, uses 8 bytes, 15-16 digits
char letter = 'a';               // Character
bool yes = true;                // Boolean - true and false in C++ are all lowercase letters
You can also use auto to let the computer automatically assign a data type to your variable
Note: You must assign the value of the variable at the same time if using auto.
auto num = 5 -> num will be automatically an integer


String is not part of base C++, it needs std::string. String should be imported when you #include <iostream>, if not then #include <String>
std::string text = "Hello World!";  // String
To get a specific character from a string, same as python word[0], or word.at(0)
Change value of a specific character in a string word[0] = 'A'; or word.at(0) = 'A';
The escape character in C++ is also \, so to type " in a string its \", additionally, \n is next line, \t is tab
Position â‰  index of a string. Position is index + 1
String streams allow treating strings like input/output streams, which is useful for parsing and formatting, including converting numbers to strings and others, more info check stringStreams.txt

Functions for strings:
.empty() check if a string is empty
.front() get first char of string
.back() get last char of string
.append() appending something to string
.push_back() appending a char to end of string
.length() or .size() to get length of a string
.substr(position, length) creates a substring with the specified conditions, if no length specified -> until end
.erase(position, length) erases chars from position 
.clear() clears string
.find() finds the position of a word or char in string
.rfind() finds the position of the last instance of word/char in string
.find_first_of("aeiou") finds the position of first char in parameters
.find_last_of("aeiou") finds position of last char in parameters
.find_first_not_of("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ") finds position of character not in parameters
.insert(position, copies, 'text') insert something at a specified position in a string, if no copies specifed -> assumed 1 copy

tolower() change char to lowercase
toupper() change char to uppercase

#include <cctype> literally character type

isalpha(c); 
isdigit(c); 
isalnum(c);
islower(c); 
isupper(c);
isspace(c); 
ispunct(c); 

const float pi = 3.14f; constant, not to be changed

Operations
Same as other languages, +, -, *, /, %, ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
Logical operators: && = and, || = or, ! = not
Pre-increment/decrement, post-increment/decrement: ++a, --a, a++, a-- difference in executing action first or adding first

Operators are evaluated in a specific order:

Parentheses ()
Unary operators (++, --, !, etc.)
Multiplication, division, modulus (*, /, %)
Addition, subtraction (+, -)
Relational operators (<, >, <=, >=)
Equality operators (==, !=)
Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)

C++ math:
max() and min() are included in base C++
The cmath libray adds other math functions 
#include <cmath>
sqrt()
round()
log()

If statements:
if () {

} else if () {

} else {

}

switch (expression){
    case a:
        code
        break;

    case b:
        code
        break;
    
    default:
        code  
}


For loop(similar to Java):
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "i = " << i << endl;
    }

While loop:
int i = 0;
    
while (i < 5) {
    cout << "i = " << i << endl;
    i++;
}

Break and continue are the same thing as in other languages, break; and continue;

The <vector> library: #include <vector>
A vector is basically an array that can be changed
vector<int> nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
.size() function to find size of vector
Loop through a vector
for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
    cout << nums[i] << "\n";
}
for (string word : words) {
  cout << word << "\n";
}

To append/add an item into a vector, we use .push_back()
nums.push_back(6)
To delete, .pop_back()
nums.pop_back()
